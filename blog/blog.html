            <p class="articleText">Every industry works in a box, and the web design industry has a more visible box than most: the browser. Some stunning creativity has gone on to discover ways to stretch the limits of that box (AJAX being an excellent example), but we are all still prisoners of that little window and limited internet bandwidth. Which brings me to my point. It's become popular to claim that "In tech, form doesn't follow function anymore," but that is hugely *wrong*. If anything, they
                are more closely related than ever, especially on the web. Every extra image means another pair of HTTP headers to be sent and received, another dump of bits, and slower page rendering. It creeps up on you, and before you know it, your page is loading in >1s. :'(. So the rebellious solution? Remove all images larger than 20px x 20px from your design. Use CSS3 and HTML5 instead (they are most definitely up to the task). Then make like Bootstrap, and tile your tiny images into
                a single medium sized image, compress it, and have your design float that same image, inside small divs within your page with "overflow:none", that effectively clip the image sheet to just the image you wanted.</p>

(Dec. 12, 2012)</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="articleText">The amount of time people spend typing every day is astounding. For most, Word (or LibreOffice, the open source alternative) is plenty, because they *type in a straight line*, from start to finish. We, that rare breed of brave adventurers, who use computers to actually write out code (gasp), do *not type in a straight line*. We edit, revise, grab, cut, paste, duplicate, modify, and do all sorts of other fancy things more often than we type new content. So naturally, those things should be fast, right? We shouldn't have to spend time, thousands of times a day, flailing around with the mouse to get our work done. For those of you who have yet to be introduced to the glory of real text editors, let me be the first to explain that this problem has a solution: Vim.</p>

(Dec. 11, 2012)</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="articleText">Java, being run by an interpreter, is inherently slower than C and C++. Java is also generally recognized as more "beginner friendly" than C++, and especially C, because of it's safe arrays, useful error messages, and lack of pointers (or at least hiding their presence). Those facts makes the semi-enlightened programmers among us look down on Java as a "noob tool." I don't think that's necessarily correct. If it takes you half the time to write a similar sized program with a comparable number of bugs in Java as it does in C (most of your time in C being spend in GDB sorting out which call is smashing your stack, leading to a nasty null-dereference), then write it in Java! Don't get me wrong, I'm in love with the raw power of C, but spending an extra 2 days working in C to save your server 2ms per request, unless you're working at absolutely massive scale, doesn't make any sense. Computer time is less valuable than human time in most things, and especially on modern machines, where computing power comes extremely cheap, so just write the code the beautiful, human readable way, and let the computer churn for an extra few ms. It will make your code so much more maintainable, bug free, and pleasant to work with.</p>
