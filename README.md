Open Source, web based Project Management that makes sense in the trenches, not on paper (though it makes sense on paper too)

Description:
==========

We're making good project management software *for small, innovative programming/design teams*. We are *not* building software for everyone, and have no interest in putting in features that 40 year olds in big beurocratic companies need. The key idea is dependencies. *Almost everything* in small team code/design projects relies on something else already being done. So why not plan your projects as a graph of dependencies? Do these things, then do those things. And what better way
to see dependencies than working with a graph? Whiteboard aims to do
that. We're *not guessing schedules*, because those guesses are meaningless. Work as fast as you can, and we'll stay on top of what still needs to get done, and provide you with nice checklists based on who's working on what, and what's already finished. No more asking around for a project. Let Whiteboard kill your down time ;)

Auxilliary Goals:
==========
(add your ideas here)

- It would be really cool to gamify the production experience with badges ("office hero" for finishing a project that atleast one other person passed on, "speedy gonzales" for finished 10 items in the same day, etc.). Let's do that.


High minded principles section: 
==========
(never speak of them, think of them always)


Programming:
----------
1. Build what you want to use. Don't let competion ever justify a feature.
2. Less code means fewer bugs. Does the absence of that feature make you want to use it less?
3. Optimization is the biggest cause of programming sins. For now, just don't.
4. Comment, comment, comment.
5. Use a real text editor. Vim or Emacs, or something else. It will make you faster, which is better.

Design:
----------
1. Exceed the medium artistically, not technologically. Don't use lots of images when some CSS and JS will do.
2. Don't make users think. Computers are supposed to do that for us, not to us.
3. Don't copy where it doesn't fit. Otherwise, copy shamelessly.
