ant -- rebuild server with your changes and make it go live

git pull origin master -- pull up all the changes from github (get in sync with other people)

When you make a change, do:
1. git add file/you/modified.js 
2. git commit 
3. git push origin master (send it to github)
4. if you want the changes to go live, type "ant" (in the whiteboard directory)

To search a directory's files for a string (say "example blah") you would do:
grep "example blah" *
